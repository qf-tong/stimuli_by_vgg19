This following code is originally from https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-cluster-images-based-on-visual-similarity-cd6e7209fe34 and adapted by Qingfeng Tong and Donghao Zhang. We use the pretrained VGG19 model to cluster the images sampled from ShapeNet (currently 270 .png images of aeroplanes). This is to create a meaning space with visually similar graphs, which is fashioned after Hawkins et al. (2023).
